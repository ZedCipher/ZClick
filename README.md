# ZClick

## Overview
ZClick is an open-source, minimalist auto-clicker designed specifically for Upwork users. Its primary function is to simulate mouse clicks to register user activity for Upwork's time/activity tracker, thereby showing the user as active even when away from the computer.

## Features
- **Automated Clicking**: Performs mouse click automatically every 50 seconds.
- **Simplicity**: Runs right out of the box with no setup or configuration needed.
- **Hotkey Support**: Easily toggle the clicking on or off using the F6 key.
- **System Tray Integration**: Features a system tray icon that displays red when inactive and green when actively clicking.
